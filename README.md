# Forms_and_user_inputs

#### In this repo I have been learning about Forms, form validation, user inputs and how to extract the data from user inputs using useState, useRef, and FormData constructor. Outsourcing validation functions and creating a useInput hook to simplify the code.
#### There are many comments on the files :)
